Y de yapa, el [genial mail](http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1401.0/01240.html) a la lista de correo preguntando si se puede reescribir el kernel en perl.

	To Dear Perl and LINUX kernel development community:

	My propose to you at your list: is possible to write operate system in PERL? I am student in university, looked for interest project to conclude my study on LINUX kernel.

	This semester, I take beginner PERL course and learn power of procedural language. I automate many daily task with use of it. Very impressive ability to make many thing work, interpret or can compile also.

	Also about LINUX, I talk to much fellow students and professors, and take a operate system course use FreeBSD and LINUX. FreeBSD okay, but they say LINUX kernel is too big and bloat, run poor with too many developer. And too much quick decision from leader with ego is too big and bloat too, kekeke.

	LINUX kernel can perform more good if written in not C and C++ but Perl? Just certain portion of LINUX kernel to rewrite? For instant, schedule or support of multithread? If so, should use Perl5 or Perl6, focus to x86 or x86-64? Can you want to join me this my project? But to hear your expertise.

	Am excited to learn and begin study project. Can you want to join this my project? Please direct reply of email to myself.

	Much thank to you,
	Antti Heikkinen
